Introduction
------------

The RDFa Test Suite is a set of webservices, markup and tests that can 
be used to verify RDFa Processor conformance. The goal of the suite is
to provide an easy and comprehensive RDFa testing solution for developers. 

Design
------

The RDFa Test suite allows developers to mix and match RDFa test manifests, 
RDFa processor endpoints and SPARQL endpoints. Processing happens in the
following order:

RDFa Test Manifest -> RDFa Test Suite -> RDFa processor -> SPARQL endpoint

The RDFa Test Suite drives the entire process. The first step is to
retrieve the list of tests that should be run for a particular manifest.
Then the RDFa test suite uses the processor that was selected to
extract the triples and send those triples, along with what triples are
expected (via a SPARQL query) to the SPARQL endpoint. The end result is a
yes/no on whether the expected triples were extracted by the RDFa processor.

Contributing
------------

If you would like to contribute a new test or a fix to an existing test,
please follow these steps:

1. Notify the RDFa mailing list, public-rdf-wg@w3.org, 
   that you will be creating a new test or fix and the purpose of the
   change.
2. Clone the git repository: git@github.com:msporny/rdfa-test-suite.git
3. Make your changes and submit them via github, or via a 'git format-patch'
   to Manu Sporny <msporny@digitalbazaar.com> or to the RDFa mailing list.
